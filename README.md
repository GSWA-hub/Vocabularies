## Introduction
Welcome to the public vocabulary repository of the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA). This repository publishes the approved vocabularies to display on VocPrez (https://github.com/RDFLib/Prez). 


The vocabularies listed here are GSWAâ€™s indexes for internal and external use. They cover a wide range of geological, scientific and administrative themes. It aims to build a controlled geoscience vocabulary for GSWA that includes unified, standardised and externally
aligned terminology defining the key scientific terms, relationships and actions that underpin our data/systems.

Each individual vocabulary includes:
 - a concept scheme defining the theme of the vocabulary, with provenance notes
 - a hierarchical list of concepts (or preferred labels), with alternate labels and notations where applicable
 - for each concept, a definition describing the term as it is used by the geological community, together with notes about provenance and links to the main sources consulted
 - if applicable, collections that represent meaningful groupings of terms
 - static Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that uniquely identify both the concept scheme and individual concepts.
